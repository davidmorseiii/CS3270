## Description

### Module 5: Unit Testing
#### Added comprehensive unit tests to verify functionality of entire codebase.

* New features incorporated:
  * Unit Tests: Implemented a full set of tests covering all classes and methods.
  * Test Coverage: Verified logic for taking in csv data, generator processing, and statistical analysis.
* How they meet phase expectations:
  * Code Quality: Ensured reliability through testing of success and failure scenarios.
  * Regression Testing: Established good baseline to prevent future changes from breaking existing functionality.

## Project Setup
- IDE: PyCharm Professional
- Environment: Windows 11
- Source Control: GitHub
- Notes: I have been using Linux with VS Code to program for several years now, and I realized that I'm not nearly as comfortable on Windows as I want to be.
  I'm choosing to work on Windows and try a new IDE this semester to strengthen my confidence with Windows and learn something new.
