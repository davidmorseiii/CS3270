# Weather App
A semester long weather app project for CS 3270.

---
## Description

### Phase 1: Optimal Python Development Lifecycle
#### Fetches weather data from a CSV file and stores it in Python data structures.

* New features incorporated:
  * File I/O: Implemented logic to read CSV files using the pandas library.
  * Data Structuring: Converted data into Python list of dictionaries for easy iteration/access.
  * Validation: Added check for empty dataset before processing
* How they meet phase expectations:
  * The project now successfully fetches data from a CSV and stores it in internal Python structures.
    The code is also documented using docstrings and inline comments.
    The modular design prepares it for future phases.

## Project Setup
- IDE: PyCharm Professional
- Environment: Windows 11
- Source Control: GitHub
- Notes: I have been using Linux with VS Code to program for several years now and I realized that I'm not nearly as comfortable in Windows as I want to be.
  I'm choosing to work in Windows and try a new IDE this semester to strengthen my confidence in Windows and learn something new.
